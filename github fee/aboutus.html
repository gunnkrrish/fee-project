      <p style="color: rgb(60, 93, 141);">Surveys provide researchers with reliable, usable, primary data to inform business decisions. They are important because the data comes directly from the individuals you have identified in your goal. And surveys give you a detailed, systematic way to view and analyze your data. 
      </p>
      <p style="color: rgb(60, 93, 141);">For example, suppose your goal is to find out what your customers want from your brand. In that case, a survey is the method of research that allows you to ask customers your questions directly, collect their answers, and use the data to decide what features or products you’ll provide in response.</p>
